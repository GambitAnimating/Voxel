# Setting up
1. Go download GLEW and SDL 2.0 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/2.0.0/glew-2.0.0-win32.zip/download, http://libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-VC.zip, please use whatever version of windows / linux / mac)
2. Include the directories to your project, also make sure you add the the libraries or you'll get link errors!
3. Run the code, and bam! You're done!
